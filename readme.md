# The Regex Word Formatting Script
*By AgentLoneStar007*

This script is extremely simple to use. Just do the following:

### 1. Enter desired words into input.txt.
BE SURE TO LEAVE ONE EMPTY LINE AT THE BOTTOM, OR LAST LINE WILL BE MISSING THE ENDING "*).*"
### 2. Run the script.
A file named "*output.txt*" will be created, containing all the words, properly formatted with Regex. (Please note: you have to change all the "?b" statements to "\b"
before you can put it into the *config.yml* file of the plugin. If I make it do it automatically, it weirds out the statement in the *.txt* file, and the *config.yml* file.)
